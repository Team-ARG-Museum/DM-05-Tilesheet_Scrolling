![Image](http://www.team-arg.org/images/demos/TilesheetScrolling.gif)

This demo shows how to do vertical background scrolling with double RLE compression !

You start by designing multiple background map parts (5 for example), using the tilesheet, spritesheet way. Now you can make an array of those 5 parts and combine them into 1 big map, by repeating them as much as you want in any order you want.
